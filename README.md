# jim-porter-construction

This is a website I built to showcase some of Jim Porter's construction work and his business. I built it with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and I am using the [hugo-scroll](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-scroll/) theme. I am hosting the site with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) at [jimporter.construction](https://jimporter.construction/).
